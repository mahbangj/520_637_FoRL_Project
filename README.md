Foundation of Reinforcement Learning Project


In this project, we explored the application of transfer learning in reinforcement learning (RL), with a focus on its potential to improve learning efficiency and performance in two Atari games, Pong and Breakout. A Deep Q-Network (DQN) was trained on Pong and the learned knowledge (i.e. weights) was transferred to learn Breakout. With different techniques such as frame stacking, preprocessing, and using a confidence factor to balance pre-trained and new weights, we demonstrate the benefits of transfer learning. The results show that transfer learning improves training efficiency and policy performance in Breakout, compared to training a DQN on Breakout from scratch. Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings, with their limitations, and propose future work. This project highlights the potential of transfer learning in improving performance and efficiency of training RL agents on new, but related tasks.
